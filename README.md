# Security Engineering Portfolio 

## Introduction

Hi, I’m **Bhavesh** — an aspiring security engineer with a strong focus on **hands-on offensive security, blue-team awareness, and clear technical reporting**.

This repository is a curated portfolio of my practical work in vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and security research. It reflects how I approach real-world security problems: starting from enumeration, validating assumptions, exploiting misconfigurations, and clearly communicating risk and impact.

I maintain this portfolio as a living record of my learning, experimentation, and improvement, while preparing for entry-level roles in security engineering, SOC operations, and VAPT.

This repository serves as a **practical security portfolio** documenting my hands-on work in:
- Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)
- Web and Linux exploitation
- Enumeration-driven methodology
- Reporting and communication of security findings

It is intentionally structured to reflect **how real security work is performed**, not just how CTFs are solved.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists for **two audiences**:

### Recruiters & Hiring Managers
To demonstrate:
- How I approach unfamiliar systems
- How I document findings clearly
- How I reason through exploitation and impact
- That I can communicate risk, not just run tools

### Security Learners & Aspiring Hackers
To provide:
- Realistic write-ups with mistakes, dead ends, and corrections
- Sample penetration testing reports
- Practical enumeration and exploitation workflows
- Learning-oriented explanations instead of copy-paste exploits

---

## What’s Inside

### CTF & Lab Write-Ups
Write-ups are based on platforms like **TryHackMe** and similar intentionally vulnerable environments.

Each write-up includes:
- Reconnaissance and enumeration strategy
- Decision-making during exploitation
- Privilege escalation analysis
- Post-exploitation impact
- Reflections on what could have been done better

These are **methodology-first**, not “tool dumps”.

---

### Learning Journal
Some content is intentionally exploratory:
- Misconfigurations I misunderstood initially
- Enumeration paths that failed
- Assumptions that turned out wrong

This reflects how actual assessments work — rarely linear, often iterative.

---

## Skills Demonstrated 

- Network & service enumeration
- Web application attack surface analysis
- Linux privilege escalation
- Credential abuse and lateral movement
- Misconfiguration discovery
- Risk analysis and communication
- Technical documentation

No skill listed here is claimed without being **backed by visible work** in this repository.

---

## Ethical Scope
All targets documented here are:
- Purposefully vulnerable labs
- CTF environments
- Systems I had explicit permission to test

No real-world targets or unauthorized testing is involved.

---

## Career Intent
I am pursuing entry-level roles such as:
- **Junior Security Engineer**
- **Security Trainee / Intern**
- **Junior VAPT / Pentesting roles**
- **SOC Analyst (Tier 1)**

This repository is maintained to reflect **continuous improvement**, not static achievement.

If you’re evaluating this repository as part of a hiring process, I encourage you to review:
- A full write-up
- The progression across posts

They represent how I think, not just what I know.
