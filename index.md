## Hi i am Bhavesh


### About Me

I hold a **Bachelor of Science in Information Technology** degree and am currently close to completing the **eJPT (eLearn Junior Penetration Tester)** certification.  
I aim to build a career in **Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)** and **cloud security**.

I document my learning journey in offensive security through hands-on labs, CTFs, and practical experimentation.

This site primarily contains **TryHackMe write-ups** written from a **VAPT mindset**, focusing on:
- Enumeration-first methodology
- Understanding misconfigurations
- Learning from mistakes and dead ends
- Clear, reproducible steps rather than shortcuts

I intentionally keep these write-ups **raw and transparent** to reflect how real assessments unfold — not everything works on the first try, and that’s part of the process.
